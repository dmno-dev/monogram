// tsx-issue-cases.ts — REAL .tsx highlighting bugs reported against the official VS Code
// TypeScriptReact grammar (generated from microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage), as DATA (no
// side effects on import). Shared by test/issue-table.ts (the README cross-language table).
//
// Monogram's .tsx is the JSX dialect DERIVED from the conformance-proven TS base (withJsx) —
// not a separate hand-written grammar. The first cases are ones the hand-written official grammar
// gets wrong: it breaks a generic-arrow type-param list with a default/const modifier to
// `invalid.illegal` (the `<` is taken as a JSX tag), and lumps a member-expression tag name
// into one component token. The derived grammar disambiguates both. (#1033 is one of these — a
// generic arrow `<T = string,>({…}: P<T>) => …` whose default the official mis-reads as a JSX tag,
// cascading the `=>` to `invalid.illegal`; Monogram keeps it a function arrow — an only-Monogram win.)
//
// The ledger is HONEST, not cherry-picked. #825 — a `<` and the tag name split across lines —
// defeats the official (a TextMate `begin` is single-line, so its tag-open can't span the break);
// the derived grammar recovers it with a children-only multi-line tag-open (a lone `<` is an
// unambiguous tag opener inside JSX children), so #825 is now an only-Monogram win. #1033 (the
// generic arrow above) is likewise only-Monogram. The rest the derived grammar wins or ties:
// #794 / #754 / #585 / #667 / #624 are both-pass — a non-null `!` then `/` division
// keeps the `/>` closing the tag; a JSX element after a `/**/` block comment switches into JSX; a
// `//` comment inside an open tag is scoped as a comment; real reported cascades both now handle.
// Each of #794 / #754 / #585 was an only-official miss until the derived grammar caught up. #754 in
// particular: the expression-start trigger learned to see past a leading block comment to the tag —
// anchored on the operator BEFORE the comment, so `a /**/ <b>` stays a comparison — see gen-tm's
// `leadComments` / `blockCommentMatchers` (the block-comment regex is DERIVED, never hardcoded).
// Every `src` was ground-truthed as valid JSX with tsc (ScriptKind.TSX, 0 parse diagnostics; the
// node kind confirms a real JsxElement, not a generic arrow), so a failing check is a true miss.

  // #794 (both solve this now). Inside a JSX-attribute object, a non-null `!` followed by ` / ` is a

  // of a regex/relational run, mis-scoping the self-closing `/>` as a relational operator instead of

  // see gen-tm's `leadComments`). So `<Element />` switches into JSX and `Element` is a tag, while
  // `a /**/ <b>` (an operand precedes the comment) stays a comparison. tsc: JsxSelfClosingElement,

  // #825 (only-Monogram — the official still misses it). `<` and the tag name split across lines —
  // a chevron alone on one line, the name on the next. Valid JSX (tsc: nested JsxElements, 0 diags)
  // and Monogram's PARSER accepts it. A TextMate `begin` regex is single-line, so the single-line
  // tag-open `(<)\s*name` cannot span the `<`/name line break — `\s*` never crosses the newline
  // within one `tokenizeLine`, which is why the official (and Monogram's single-line elements) leave
  // `span` as `meta.jsx.children`. The official has no recovery; Monogram does. The lone `<` here is
  // in JSX CHILDREN, where a bare `<` is ALWAYS a tag opener (tsc rejects a stray `<` in children —
  // `<div>a < b</div>` is a parse error), so it is UNAMBIGUOUS. Monogram adds a children-only
  // multi-line tag-open (gen-tm's `jsx-element-multiline`): it opens on a lone `<` reaching EOL
  // (`(<)(?=\s*$)`) and recovers the name — plus attributes, type-args, children, and the matching
  // close — when they arrive on following lines. Scoped to children (never expression-start), so a
  // split comparison `a <\n b` or generic `f<\n T>` outside JSX is untouched. `span` → `entity.name.tag`.
